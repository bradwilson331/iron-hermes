### Phase 28.1: AgentRuntime channel migration (budget/skills/tools ownership) per docs/AGENT-RUNTIME-DESIGN.md (INSERTED)

**Goal:** `AgentRuntime` is the single channel-facing agent API: every channel (Telegram gateway, web UI, CLI `run_chat`/`run_single`, TUI) builds one `AgentRuntime` and calls `run_turn(TurnRequest)` per top-level turn. No channel constructs `BudgetHandle`s or assembles `AgentLoop`s by hand; the run-boundary owns budget reset, permanently fixing the `Stop100` latch class for current and future channels. Cron gets a separate runtime/budget so scheduled turns do not drain interactive chat.
**Requirements**: AGENT-RUNTIME-MIGRATION (scope + locked decisions §6 in docs/AGENT-RUNTIME-DESIGN.md and 28.1-CONTEXT.md)
**Depends on:** Phase 28
**Plans:** 6/6 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 28.1-01-PLAN.md — AgentRuntime budget-reset regression test (foundational proof; agent crate)
- [x] 28.1-02-PLAN.md — Gateway → run_turn; remove 367eaa79 band-aid (highest value)
- [x] 28.1-03-PLAN.md — Web UI → run_turn; close top-level-loop budget gap
- [x] 28.1-04-PLAN.md — CLI run_chat + run_single → run_turn; fix run_chat latch
- [x] 28.1-05-PLAN.md — TUI → run_turn; fix latch + max_turns/max_iterations drift
- [x] 28.1-06-PLAN.md — Cron distinct runtime/budget (§6.4); preserve per-job overrides

**Note:** Stage 4 (skills + tool-registry ownership fully into AgentRuntime, design §4) is intentionally DEFERRED to a follow-up phase — see planning summary. It would edit the same channel files this phase migrates and is independently shippable per §5.
